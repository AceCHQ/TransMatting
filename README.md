The extended paper [TransMatting: Tri-token Equipped Transformer Model for Image Matting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06476.pdf) is published on arXiv. We further propose TransMattingV2, which extends tri-token to both convolutional networks and Transformer. Various experiments demonstrate that it could boost both Transformer and convolutional networks, indicating that the proposed tri-token has the potential to be a new paradigm for image matting.
